\section{Other Options}
If there are no affordable flights to the above airports, you could also fly to Luton, Heathrow or Gatwick, but it will take longer and cost more to get to site from these airports. If you wish to visit London or elsewhere in the UK before/after camp, it of course may make sense to fly to/from a different airport. 

For anyone who needs funding and/or visas, we ask that you do not book flights until these are secured. 

Feel free to ask our advice on booking your travel, including hiring coaches and travelling over land! Email info@camp100.org.uk and we'll be happy to advise.
