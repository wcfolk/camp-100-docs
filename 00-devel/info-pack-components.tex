\chapter{Callouts}
\section{We already have standard callouts with titles}
\begin{callout-red}{Title}
Here is a red callout.

This can be used to display warning, for example something changing between document versions or to make a point obvious.
\end{callout-red}

\begin{callout-orange}{Title}
Here is an orange callout.

Not sure where it gets used, but it might?
\end{callout-orange}

\begin{callout-green}{Title}
Here is a green callout.

Notice how all the colours used in callouts are actually the Camp 100 colors but at different intensities.

\section{And now, we have Bold Callouts}


\begin{callout-bold-red}
blah

blah
\end{callout-bold-orange}

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions.
